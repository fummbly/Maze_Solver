# Maze Solver

Basic maze solving program in Python using Tk for the drawing framework.

![demo gif](assets/demo.gif) \*_this is sped up_

## Installing

clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/fummbly/maze_solver
```

and then run the main file with python

```
python main.py
```

## Usage

The program has optional arguments

`--rows` for designating the amount of rows for the maze

`--cols` for designating the amount of columns in the maze

`--seed` for making repeatable random generation

## Future features

- [ ] Create arguments for selecting different search algorithms
- [ ] Automate window size based off size of maze
- [ ] Speed argument for changing the speed of the animation

## What I learned

I learned about the basic usage of the Tk framework, and how to break out functions for abstraction. I also learned how to make a Depth First Search for solving the maze recursively
